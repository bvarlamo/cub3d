# cub3d

This was a team project, we were 2 students in a team.

How to use: make, then ./cub3D maps/xl.cub (or other map from a folder)

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It enabled us to explore ray-casting. Our goal was make a dynamic view inside a maze.

This project’s objectives were similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.

As a graphic design project, cub3D enabled us to improve your skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, we used mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms
